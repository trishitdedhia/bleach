# Bleach
Part of the image processing libraries used by Karla. Bleach allows the user to wash all pixels in an image to a specific colour while retaing alpha (opacity) values. Typically designed to change icon colours.

### Using Karla
Installation: Teach karla to bleach.
```
karla learn bleach
```

Usage: Make karla execute this skill.
```
karla bleach <image>
```
The program will itself ask you for the pixel values during runtime.


### Usage without a package manager.
Run `./main <image>` when inside the bleach directory.

Note: The python pillow library and python itself are required for this program to run.
